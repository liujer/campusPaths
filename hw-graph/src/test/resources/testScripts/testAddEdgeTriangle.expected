# Tests adding of edges by using a three node graph and
# connecting them in a triangle formation
Created graph A
Added node one to A
Added node two to A
Added node three to A
Added edge e12 to A
Added edge e23 to A
Added edge e31 to A
ListNodes of A output: one three two
the children of one in A are: two(e12)
the children of two in A are: three(e23)
the children of three in A are: one(e31)
