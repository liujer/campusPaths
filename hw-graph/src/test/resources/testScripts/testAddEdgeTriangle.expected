# Tests adding of edges by using a three node graph and
# connecting them in a triangle formation
created graph A
added node one to A
added node two to A
added node three to A
added edge e12 from one to two in A
added edge e23 from two to three in A
added edge e31 from three to one in A
A contains: one three two
the children of one in A are: two(e12)
the children of two in A are: three(e23)
the children of three in A are: one(e31)
