# Tests adding of edges by having multiple
# nodes point to one node
Created graph E
Added node one to E
Added node two to E
Added node three to E
Added edge e12 to E
Added edge e32 to E
ListNodes of E output: one three two
the children of one in E are: two(e12)
the children of two in E are:
the children of three in E are: two(e32)
