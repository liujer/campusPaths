# Tests adding of edges by having multiple
# nodes point to one node
created graph E
added node one to E
added node two to E
added node three to E
added edge e12 from one to two in E
added edge e32 from three to two in E
E contains: one three two
the children of one in E are: two(e12)
the children of two in E are:
the children of three in E are: two(e32)
