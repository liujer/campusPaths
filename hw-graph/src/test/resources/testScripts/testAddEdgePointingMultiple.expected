# Tests adding of edges by having one node point
# to multiple nodes
created graph D
added node one to D
added node two to D
added node three to D
added edge e12 from one to two in D
added edge e13 from one to three in D
D contains: one three two
the children of one in D are: three(e13) two(e12)
the children of two in D are:
the children of three in D are:
