# Tests the method getLabel in DLGraph by adding nodes
# and edges to a graph and checking if the label returned
# is correct
Created graph A

Label of one and two in A output: e12
Label of one and three in A output: e13
Label of two and three does not exist in A
Label of one and Two does not exist in A
Created graph B
