# Tests the method listChildren of DLGraph by adding
# multiple nodes with the same children
created graph B
added node one to B
added node two to B
added node three to B
added edge e12 from one to two in B
added edge e32 from three to two in B
the children of one in B are: two(e12)
the children of two in B are:
the children of three in B are: two(e32)
