# Tests if Dijkstra's algorithm will choose the longer path
# in terms of number of nodes in the path
created graph A
added node one to A
added node two to A
added node three to A

added edge 1.000 from one to two in A
added edge 1.000 from two to three in A
added edge 3.000 from one to three in A

path from one to three:
one to two with weight 1.000
two to three with weight 1.000
total cost: 2.000
