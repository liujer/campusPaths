# Find a path using Dijkstra's algorithm when there are two paths
# with identical weight
# Should add based on when node was first added
created graph A
added node one to A
added node two to A
added node three to A
added node four to A

added edge 2.000 from one to two in A
added edge 2.000 from one to three in A
added edge 1.000 from two to four in A
added edge 1.000 from three to four in A

path from one to four:
one to two with weight 2.000
two to four with weight 1.000
total cost: 3.000
