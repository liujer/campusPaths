#### Overall Feedback

Your TA forgot to give feedback!  Shame on them.

#### More Details

- For next time, if you implement a class that isn't an ADT, you should add an
  internal comment that explicitly says so where the ADT/RI would normally go.

- Your BFS method is complex, and should hence have some internal
  comments/documentation to improve its readability and understandability.

- Your main methof for MarvelPaths should have some documentation explaining the
  functionality of the command line application.

- Test suites missing many edge/interesting cases

- Command line output missing connecting comic books
