## CSE 331 hw-setup Questions
## Part 6

1. Why did Fibonacci fail the testThrowsIllegalArgumentException< test? What (if anything) did
you have to do to fix it? If you did not have to change anything to fix this issue, explain why.

0 was considered a nonnegative number, yet the method threw an IllegalExceptionError when 0 was passed in.
By changing the initial if condition to (n < 0) from (n <= 0), the method correctly threw an
IllegalExceptionError when n was negative.

2. Why did Fibonacci fail the testBaseCase test? What (if anything) did you have to do to fix
it? If you did not have to change anything to fix this issue, explain why.
The first number in the sequence started with 0 instead of 1. By changing the code so that
the first two numbers in the sequence started with 1, the testBaseCase test was satisfied.


3.Why did Fibonacci fail the testInductiveCase test? What (if anything) did you have to do to
fix it? If you did not have to change anything to fix this issue, explain why.
The numbers were being subtracted rather than added to previous "sums". Changing the return statement to
add both values instead of subtract fixed this issue.

## Part 7
Added a SortByVolume class that implemented Comparator interface in Box.java to compare balls
based on their volumes
